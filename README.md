# Next.js Starter

This is a starter Next.js project that shows how to put together a simple website with server and client side rendering powered by Next.js, which uses React.

It provides an example with header, footer and layout files, shows how to include CSS and JavaScript on specific pages, how to write code that does asynchronous data fetching (including how to write different routines for client and server rendering, if you wish) as well as some more advanced usage.

Like all Next.js projects it features automatic pre-fetching of templates with a ServiceWorker, renders pages both client and server side and live reloading in development.
