# Next.js 2.0 Starter

This is a starter Next.js 2.0 project that shows how to put together a simple website with server and client side rendering powered by Next.js, which uses React.

Like all Next.js projects it features automatic pre-fetching of templates with a ServiceWorker, renders pages both client and server side and live reloading in development. It also shows how to use features new in Next.js version 2.0 like integration with the Express and custom route handling.

There are practical examples with header, footer and layout files, how to add page-specific CSS and JavaScript and header elements, how to write code that does asynchronous data fetching (including how to write different logic for client and server rendering, as well as some more advanced usage, including email based authentication.
